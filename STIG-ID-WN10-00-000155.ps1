#>

# --- Start of Script ---

# This Stops the script if any command fails
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"

# --- Configuration Parameters ---
# Define any variables the script will use, like registry paths or feature names.
Write-Host "--- Applying STIG [STIG-ID] Remediation ---"
# Announce what the script is about to do.

# --- Step 1: Check Prerequisites (e.g., Admin rights) ---
# It's good practice to verify the script is running as an Administrator.

# --- Step 2: Main Logic (e.g., Change Registry or Feature) ---
# This is where the core command goes. Use Try/Catch for robust error handling.
try {
    Write-Host "Performing the main action..."
    # The command to disable a feature or set a registry key goes here.
    Write-Host "Action completed successfully."
}
catch {
    Write-Error "An error occurred during the main action: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    # The script will stop here because of $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
}

# --- Step 3: Verification ---
# Always check your work. Read the value back to confirm the change was made.
try {
    Write-Host "`n--- Verifying Changes ---"
    # The command to get the current setting goes here.
    # Compare the current setting to the desired setting.
